        <h2>FUNDING AND SPONSORSHIP</h2>
        <!-- <p>Welcome to our funding and sponsorship page. Your support helps us achieve our goals and make a positive impact.</p> -->
        <!-- Add more content as needed -->
        <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;" >Respected Visitor,<br>Thank You for your interest, and we
            appreciate the time that you have taken to go through our website. The estimated expenditure for the design,
            fabrication, assembly, testing, validation, space qualification, launch and commissioning of SS AMU SAT
            falls in the tune of nearly INR 45.0 Lakhs (including estimated launch cost). So far, the students have
            managed to run this project with their own contributions. We have obtained the estimate through the <a href="https://75satellites.org/assets/75Satellites-FAQ.pdf" target="”_blank”">FAQ</a> published by the 75
            Student Satellite Programme initiated by the <a href="https://75satellites.org" target="”_blank”">ITCA</a>.
            However, the members have been trying to manufacture the components in-house so as to bring down the overall
            cost. <br> Considering the total requirement, it is evident that the small pool of students' contribution
            will not be sufficient to launch our project into Space. In view of this, generous contribution is requested
            from all to help us realise this project. <br> The bank account details for donations shall be updated very
            soon on the website.</p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p class="p2" style="text-align:justify;">Monetory contributions are welcome and we would also appreciate your kind
                efforts to procure the intended items. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pw9yG0JOMKh1sUHhOMyVj8c4920brgum/view?usp=share_link" target="”_blank”">The brochure is available here</a>. The list of components that we are intending to buy is
                available with the <b>Project Incharge</b> (<a href="https://www.amu.ac.in/faculty/electronics-engineering/ekram-khan" target="”_blank”">Prof. Ekram
                  Khan</a> | ekhan.el@amu.ac.in) and <b>Project Mentor</b> (<a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/iamfarazahmad" target="”_blank”">Mr. Faraz Ahmad</a> |
                imfarazahmad@gmail.com). Alternatively, for our dearest contributers who wish to make monetory donations, we
                shall provide the account details upon request.<br> The interested contributers may e-mail their contact
                informations to the Project In-charge or Project Mentor as mentioned below. The list of required components
